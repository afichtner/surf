In principle, the two equations above should give the same result. Differences may arise because (1) the root finding algorithm did not determine the phase velocity $c$ with sufficient accuracy, (2) the numerical integration is not accurate enough, e.g., because the vertical increment $dr$ is too large, (3) the finite-difference approximation is not perfect and used with a too large $\\delta m$, and finally (4) floating-point errors.\n",
