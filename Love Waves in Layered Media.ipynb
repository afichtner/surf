A common approach, that we follow here, is to pick a frequency $\\omega$ and some trial wave number $k$. The equations of motion are then integrated from the bottom towards the surface. If, for that specific $k$, the free-surface condition is satisfied reasonably well, we have found a reasonable $k$. Otherwise, another trial wave number $k$ is tested, and so on and so forth.\n",
